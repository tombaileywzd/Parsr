2 Quantifying Fuel-Saving Opportunities from Specific Driving Behavior Changes

2.1 Savings from Improving Individual Driving Profiles

2.1.1 Drive Profile Subsample from Real-World Travel Survey

The interim report (Gonder et al. 2010) included results from detailed analyses on five cycles selected from a large set of real-world global positioning system (GPS) travel data collected in 2006 as part of a study by the Texas Transportation Institute and the Texas Department of Transportation (Ojah and Pearson 2008). The cycles were selected to reflect a range of kinetic intensity (KI) values. (KI represents a ratio of characteristic acceleration to aerodynamic speed and has been shown to be a useful drive cycle classification parameter [O’Keefe et al. 2007].) To determine the maximum possible cycle improvement fuel savings, the real-world cycles were converted into equivalent “ideal” cycles using the following steps:
